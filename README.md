## About

This program was made in the span of a week as one of my side projects during the summer.

Watching the development of <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">SerenityOS</a> made me want to give C++ another try.

## Options

There are a couple optional ways to draw the map:

Lines                   |Arrows                   | Markers

## Todo

* Make GUI elements responsive.
* Fix random crashes.
* Better design / styling.
* Interactive map.
* Make short paths easier to see
  * Either with interactive map or zooming.
