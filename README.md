## About

This program was made in the span of a week as one of my side projects during the summer.

Watching the development of <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">SerenityOS</a> made me want to give C++ another try.

## Todo

* Make GUI elements responsive.
* Fix random crashes.
* Better design / styling.
